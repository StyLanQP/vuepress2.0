# Overview

The Platform enables IoT solutions with its modular approach in design and deployment, consisting of these main components: IoT Gateway (IOTGW), Device Management Platform (DMP). Each component can also be deployed independently based on the service requirements:

- IOTGW handles device communication and interprets protocol and data.
- DMP handles device and session management, data collection, storage, and reporting.

The following sections will walk you through all functionalities of the TMX Accessâ„¢ Service in detail. For your convenience find an overview on the content of this document below.
